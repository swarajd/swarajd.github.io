I've been coding for about 8 years now, starting with adding images to html pages using img tags. I then moved on to learning C++ at my high school's robotics team as well as learning ruby, python, and java after coming across project euler. A few years ago, I was tasked to create my robotics team's webpage, and from there I started to code for the web. From that point on I learned everything from serverside devops to clientside web development.
